## Chapter 1


A **database** is a collection of related data.1 By data, we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning. For example, consider the names, elephone numbers, and addresses of the people you know. You may have recorded this data in an indexed address book or you may have stored it on a hard drive, using a personal computer and software such as Microsoft Access or Excel. This collection of related data with an implicit meaning is a database.

DB properties:
- A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the mini-world or the universe of discourse (UoD). Changes to the mini-world are reflected in the database.
- A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning. A random assortment of data cannot correctly be referred to as a database.
- A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose. It has an intended group of users and some preconceived applications in which these users are interested.

A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain a database. The DBMS is a *general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating, and sharing* databases among various users and applications.

- **Defining** a database involves specifying the data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be stored in the database. The database definition or descriptive information is also stored by the DBMS in the form of a database catalog or dictionary; it is called meta-data.
- **Constructing** the database is the process of storing the data on some storage medium that is controlled by the DBMS.
-  **Manipulating** a database includes functions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating the database to reflect changes in the mini-world, and generating reports from the data. 
-  **Protection** includes system protection against hardware or software malfunction (or crashes) and security protection against unauthorized or malicious access.
